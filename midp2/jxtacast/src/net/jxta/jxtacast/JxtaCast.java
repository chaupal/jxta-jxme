*
* JxtaCast release history
*
* Version numbers below correspond to the JxtaCast.version string, not to the
* CVS check-in ID.
*
* 1.00  03/18/02  Beta release.  The class was named "FileCast", and was a
*                 part of the PicShare demo.  There was an unversioned alpha
*                 on 03/09/02.
* 1.01  03/20/02  Don't show "duplicate block" message if we were the
*                 ones that sent the block.  Create pipes AFTER advs have
*                 been published.
* 1.02  03/23/02  Use "average time between blocks" calculation to determine
*                 wait time before requesting missing blocks.
*                 Shorten inactive lifetime of input wranglers to 5 minutes.
*                 Put sending peer name in more log messages.
* 1.03  04/07/02  Change name to JxtaCast, change package location.
* 1.04  10/11/02  Migrate from deprecated Message and PipeService methods.
* 2.00  04/07/03  Tested with JXTA 2.0 platform: JXTA_2_0_Stable_20030301.
*                 Bumped default block size to 12kb.  Tightened time between
*                 BossCheck checks, from 2 seconds to 1.

/*
 * JxtaCast: Sends data files to all peers in a peer group (those that are
 *           listening for them with JxtaCast).  Receives data files sent
 *           by other JxtaCast users.
 *
 *           Large files are broken up and sent in blocks.  Since blocks may
 *           arrive out of order, the receivers re-assemble all the blocks in
 *           memory before writing the file. (JxtaCast is therefore a memory hog
 *           if used with very large files...  Should change it to read/write
 *           blocks directly from disk files.)
 *
 *           The default block size is set in the public outBlockSize variable.
 *           Client applications can change this size if they wish.  The default
 *           size is 12kb.  The maximum message size that can be sent using IP
 *           multicasting is 16kb, so we want to stay under that.  You can use
 *           bigger blocks if you are always using a rendezvous.
 *
 *           This class was originally named "FileCast".  After finding that the
 *           name had already been used (oops), we changed it to JxtaCast.
 *           The string "FileCast" is still used in some places, to maintain
 *           backwards compatibility with earlier versions.
